ats2-lang-postiats-x.x.x.tgz

where x.x.x is the version of the package. You can untar it by
issuing the following command-line:

tar vxfz ats2-lang-postiats-x.x.x.tgz

which creates a directory named ATS-Postiats

######

cd ATS-Postiats

After 'make' is finsihed, the two commands 'patscc' and 'patsopt' for
compiling ATS source code can be found in ATS-Postiats/bin. In order to
use this build, please set the environment variable PATSHOME as follows
(assuming the current directory is still ATS-Postiats):

export PATSHOME=`pwd`

######

Step 3. Install the built package (optional)

export PATSHOME=/path/to/MYATS/lib/ats2-postiats-x.x.x
