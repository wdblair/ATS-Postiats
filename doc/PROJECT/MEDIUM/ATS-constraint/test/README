External Constraint Solver Tests
=================================

This directory contains some tests of experimental features to an external
constraint solver we're working on. The whole goal is to show programs
where invariants are enforced that could not previously be expressed in
the statics due to the limitation of the previous constraint solver.

- bv: constraints with fixed width bit vectors.

- array: constraints with static arrays. The first example I want to work
with is quick sort. If we can have a proveably correct implementation in far fewer
ATS lines as before, we can demonstrate the usefulness of more powerful
statics. From the paper, "What's Decidable About Arrays?" there are also some 
interesting examples about shared memory between processes expressed using
arrays.
