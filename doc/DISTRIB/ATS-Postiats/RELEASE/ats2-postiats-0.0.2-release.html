This is the second release of ATS2, the successor of the ATS
programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given the name

The official website for ATS is:

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Support for classdec.
   This feature is primarily for building APIs in ATS for external
   packages written in the OOP-style.

2. Support for ATS-package relocation.
   This feature is primarily for renaming and relocating external ATS
   packages (mostly library APIs). It is supposed to work together with
   atspkgreloc, a tool that does the actual package relocation.
