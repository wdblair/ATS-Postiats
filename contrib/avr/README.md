ATS AVR
=======

This library allows you to develop firmware for 
AVR microcontrollers in ATS2. It is largely a 
continuation of the same library that's available 
in ATS.

The template system simplifies the code overall
and offers an alternative way to develop low level
applications for multiple hardware targets.

Among other differences, this version of the AVR
library doesn't require its own runtime separate 
from the normal ATS2 runtime. This is largely
due to the solely static runtime in ATS2.
